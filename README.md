# RedditRecommendations
In this project, I'm aiming to use Spotify and Reddit APIs as well as techniques from recommendation systems to find new music to listen to! The goal of this project is two fold. First, I want to discover new artists I otherwise would not have found. Secondly, I want to learn more about the ML pipeline as a whole. From data collection and pipelining to model training and deployment, I want to gain some experience with the ML pipeline as whole. If all goes well, I will end up with an app that, once a week, uses my listening profile (or at least an approximation based on data I can gather from Spotify) to rank a large collection of Reddit song recommendations from real people!
